                Dialing 911, you're beyond surprised that your call actually goes through. After confirming that they can help, you quickly give them your address for their search and rescue team. It's a tense few minutes as you wait, but soon enough, a large truck pulls up outside your house.<br><br>
                The rescue team ushers you into the truck, and they drive you to a large, seemingly secure building. Inside, there are people of all kinds—some injured, some just trying to stay safe. It's a warehouse of sorts, but it feels like a makeshift haven from the chaos outside. You’re safe—for now.<br><br>
                It’s hard to believe it, but you feel a sense of relief wash over you. The worst might be over... for now.<br><br>
                What do you do next?<br><br>
