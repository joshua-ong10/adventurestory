                Title: The Beginning of the End<br>
                It’s a quiet morning. The kind of morning where everything seems normal, yet a sense of unease lingers in the air. You're Paul—an ordinary guy, living in a quiet suburban neighborhood. Your alarm blares, pulling you from a deep sleep. You stretch, rub your eyes, and reach for your phone. The notifications are endless: breaking news, text messages, and missed calls.<br><br>
                You swipe through the updates in a daze, your mind still foggy from sleep. But something catches your eye—a news headline that makes your stomach twist:<br>
                "Unexplained attacks spreading rapidly across the country. Hospitals overwhelmed. Authorities urge citizens to stay indoors."<br><br>
                You shake your head, assuming it's just another sensationalized story. But then you hear it: the distant wail of sirens. Your heart skips a beat. The peaceful morning you expected is far from it. Something is wrong.<br><br>
                You glance out the window. People are moving in a panic—neighbors running, cars speeding past, and others just standing in the streets, staring. You don’t know why, but you sense that something catastrophic is happening.<br><br>
                Your phone buzzes again, this time with a text from your friend, Mark.<br>
                "Paul, you need to get out of the house. It's happening. People are losing their minds. Get to me ASAP."<br><br>
                Before you can even process the message, there's a sudden, loud crash from down the street, followed by a high-pitched scream. The kind of scream that shakes you to your core.<br><br>
                You need to act fast. What do you do?<br><br>
                Your options ----->
