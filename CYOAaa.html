    <div class="container">
        <div class="left-column">
            <p>
                You decide to approach Tim and check if he's okay. As you draw closer, you can see his face—his eyes are wide, and his expression is twisted in an unnatural way. Suddenly, he lunges at you, his teeth clamping down on your arm with a force that takes you by surprise. You gasp, but it's too late to react. 
                His grip is unyielding as pain shoots through your arm. You try to scream, but your vision starts to blur, and an overwhelming sensation of weakness washes over you.<br><br>
                The last thing you remember is the sound of his growls in your ear, and then... everything goes dark.<br><br>
                You’ve turned into a zombie.<br><br>
                The End.
