    <h1>Make the stupid decision of leaving your house</h1>
    <div class="container">
        <div class="left-column">
            <p>
                You make the rash decision to leave the safety of your house. Against your better judgment, you step outside, the chaos and fear surrounding you. The streets are filled with horror—zombies everywhere, some of them stumbling aimlessly while others seem to hunt for prey. You try to make your way through the neighborhood, hoping to make it to Mark's house, but it’s too late.<br><br>
                As you turn a corner, you're surrounded. The horrific creatures close in on you from all directions. You try to fight them off, but you are outnumbered and powerless. One of them lunges at you, sinking its teeth into your flesh.<br><br>
                You feel your strength fade as you lose consciousness. It’s over. You turn into a zombie.<br><br>
                Your journey ends here.
